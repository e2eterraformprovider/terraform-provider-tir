# e2e_eos (Resource)

Datasets allow you to organize, share, and easily access your data directly within your notebooks and training code. Currently, TIR supports datasets backed by EOS (Object Storage) and PVC-backed datasets with Disk Storage.


## Example Usage
```hcl

resource "e2e_eos" "disk"{
    name = "name for your disk"
    disk_size = 100
    storage_type = "disk"
    pvc_type = "custom_pvc" form disk type storage
    team_id = <team_id:string>
    project_id = <project_id:string>
    active_iam = <active_iam:string>
}

```

## Schema

### Required

- `active_iam` (String) The IAM (Identity and Access Management) role associated with your account.

- `project_id` (String) The ID of the project in which you want to create the resource.
- `storage_type` (String) The type of storage for the EOS resource. Supported values are 'new_bucket' for managed storage, 'existing_bucket' for E2E S3, and 'disk' for PVC (Persistent Volume Claim).
- `team_id` (String) The ID of the team that owns the EOS resource.

### Optional

- `bucket_name` (String) The name of the bucket associated with the EOS resource. This is computed automatically.
- `disk_size` (Number) The size of the disk (in GB) allocated for the EOS resource. This is applicable only for PVC storage type.
- `encryption_enable` (Boolean) Indicates whether encryption is enabled for the EOS resource. Default is false.
- `encryption_type` (String) The type of encryption used for the EOS resource. This is required if encryption is enabled.
- `pvc_type` (String) The type of PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) used for the EOS resource. This is applicable only for PVC storage type.

### Read-Only

- `access_key` (String) The access key for the EOS resource. This is computed automatically.
- `bucket_endpoint` (String) The endpoint URL for accessing the bucket. This is computed automatically.
- `bucket_url` (String) The URL of the bucket associated with the EOS resource. This is computed automatically.
- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the EOS resource was created. This is computed automatically.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `secret_key` (String) The secret key for the EOS resource. This is computed automatically.
- `status` (String) The current status of the EOS resource. This is computed automatically.
